            Hey! I'm Jatin Sharma, I've been close to a computer since an early
            age, and been passionate about it ever since.
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
            I really liked to build stuff using no-code tools back in 2010, and
            from that, I explored how to code myself, fast-forward to today, I
            do programming in various languages and technologies, and had the
            privilege to worked in a Recruitment Company and a SaaS Company I'm
            interested in building something awesome with code and automate
            tasks with code, currently focused on Web & Mobile Development, Open
            Source and Competitive Programming
          </p>
          <p className="text-lg mb-4">
          When I'm not coding I play games with my friends, watch some show on Netflix, or if the weather's good, play basketball! üèÄ
